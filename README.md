# WinGL
Simple library to open a window using Xlib and render using OpenGL.

The intent of this library is to graph things to the user, not to be interactive, which is why we don't handle user input.
Also was designed to be compatible with C++98 and to be as simple as possible.

**TODO:**
* Add support for Microsoft Windows using the WinAPI.
